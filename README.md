# VBA
VBA projects and useful procedures

Here I collect my VBA code. I group it into i) generic macros and ii) specific macros
Generic macros are helpful for the everyday Excel usage and could be imported into the Personal Macro Workbook. These macros are marked by having a preceding number.
Specific macros are rather special purpose codes, such as an e-mail automation code base. These macros do not have a preceding number.
