VBA projects and useful procedures

In this directory I will upload VBA projects and useful procedures. <br>
The purpose is twofold: first, I can access my code later on. Second, recruiters can view my code in application processes. <br><br>

I group the macros into two categories: i) generic macros and ii) specific macros. <br>
<b> Generic macros </b> are helpful for the everyday Excel usage and could be imported into the Personal Macro Workbook. These macros are marked by having a preceding number. <br>
<b> Specific macros </b> are rather special purpose codes, such as an e-mail automation code base. These macros do not have a preceding number.
